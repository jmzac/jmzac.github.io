This is an R Markdown document. It shows plot of the boulder data:
```{r}

## load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

## Note: Download data from figshare and save it into working directory and below we import it

## import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file="boulder-precip.csv")

## view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)


```


```{r }

# when we download the data we create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using it's name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP

```

## Including Plot

```{r precip, echo=FALSE}
# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot our data
qplot(x=boulder_precip$DATE,
      y=boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```
